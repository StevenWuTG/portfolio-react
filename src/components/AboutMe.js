                        As a avid gamer, it has always been one of my dreams to learn how to program and I fell in love after writing my first few lines of code. A day later, I've decided to turn my dreams into reality by enrolling in The Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering bootcamp.

                        Along with my coding knowledge, I have over twelve years of experience in the restaurant industry with the last six years as a manager for a busy ramen restaurant in midtown Manhattan where I handled duties such as employee scheduling, inventory management and the daily front house operation.
